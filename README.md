## WRITING MATHS LIKE CODE

### EVERY FILE IS MARKDOWN BECAUSE GITHUB PROCESSES SOME LATEX FORMATS

#### FILE NAME WILL BE NUMBER ONLY AND VERSIONED BUT IN DIFFERENT SEMANTICS 

#### EXAMPLE: 
```
XX-YY-ZZ
```
##### X REPRESENTS CONCEPT BASED (VECTOR SPACES, COMPOSITION, ETC) PROGRESSION
##### Y REPRESENTS MATHEMATICAL BUILDING BLOCK (01 FOR DEFINITION, 02 FOR LEMMA, PROPOSITION ETC, NUMBER WILL KEEP INCREASING AS CURRENT Y VERSION USES PREVIOUS Y VERSION FOR PROOF)
##### Z REPRESENTS CONSTITUENTS WITHIN Y (THERE ARE SEVERAL LIST IN DEFINITION OF VECTOR SPACES EACH WILL OCCUPY Z VERSION)
